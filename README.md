# Page Distributing Policies

Efficiency tests for OS policies distributing memory pages between processes. 

After running the program generates *output/index.html* file containing tables and plots for each policy.

It was a task used as an exercise to learn ocaml programming language.

# Running
The project uses *dune* build system.

First install *dune* on your machine and then run `dune build main.exe` command in this folder.

Run `./_build/default/main.exe 0`, instead of zero you can also choose `1` or `2`, these are simulation presets.

Open *output/index.html* in your browser.
